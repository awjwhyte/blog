# blog
Can create daily articles like an online diary
This project sets up a website with the ability to take up blog posts. First of all, you need to download the node modules. 
Navigate to your project folder on your terminal and run npm init. Before you do that though, ensure you have node JS and npm installed
Once node and npm have been installed, run npm install to install the node modules. After installing the node modules,
you can start the server by running node app.js. I however reccommend that you have nodemon installed in case you want to modify and test out the code. You can then run nodemon app.js. This will start the server and restart it in case you make any changes. Navigate to localhost:3000 on your browser and you will be served with the website.
To create a new article, you will have to add /compose to the url address such that the address becomes localhost:3000/compose
You can then create an article and add it to the list of articles on the home screen.
